    <h2 class="content">Description</h2>
    <p class="para">No game day watch party is complete without a big bowl of hearty chili. It's also the easiest choice to feed a big crowd- just keep warm in the slow cooker, set out a few toppings and let everyone help themselves. Many of the top-rated recipes here were winners at chili cook-offs.</p>
    <p class="para">Vegetarian versions made fans out of meat-lovers and a few meat only and beans or bust fanatics changed their tune. Whatever your style, we've got a chili for every pot. Grab a bowl and enjoy.</p>
